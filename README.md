# CASEF — Clinical AI Safety Evaluation Framework

Physician-led qualification framework for LLM behavior in clinical-like and other high-stakes settings.

**Core idea:**  
CASEF treats LLM safety as a **qualification problem**, not a vibe, benchmark score, or alignment claim.

It provides a reproducible structure for evaluating model behavior under explicit constraints using:

**spec → measurement → gates → evidence**

CASEF is **model-agnostic** and **platform-portable** across apps, web UIs, and APIs.  
It focuses on **reproducible external evaluation artifacts**, not internal telemetry.

---

## Why CASEF exists

Most LLM evaluation still overweights answer quality and underweights **deployment-relevant failure**.

In real use, especially in clinical and other high-stakes environments, the question is not only:

- *Can the model produce a plausible answer?*

but:

- *Does it stay within role and constraints?*
- *Does it fabricate actions or certainty?*
- *Does it fail safely when information is missing?*
- *Can its behavior be logged, reviewed, and defended?*

CASEF is designed for this layer.

It is not a benchmark leaderboard.  
It is a framework for structuring evidence for bounded qualification decisions.

---

## What CASEF evaluates

CASEF is intended for failures that matter in deployment, not just benchmark performance.

Examples include:

- format violations under explicit constraints
- hallucinated actions or unsupported claims
- unsafe reassurance
- abstain / escalate failures
- role drift under pressure
- inconsistency between stated policy and observed behavior
- artifact-level failures that break reproducibility or reviewability

---

## What makes CASEF different

Unlike benchmark-style evaluation, CASEF focuses on **portable, inspectable qualification artifacts**:

- explicit test specs
- structured logging
- artifact taxonomy
- redaction rules
- model/platform registry
- requirements for reproducible evidence packs
- bounded qualification-decision review surfaces

The goal is not to ask whether a model is “good.”  
The goal is to ask whether a behavior is **acceptable for a defined context of use**.

---

## Scope

CASEF is currently designed as a framework for:

- clinical AI reliability evaluation
- high-stakes conversational system qualification
- platform-agnostic behavioral testing
- evidence-oriented safety review
- pre-deployment or controlled evaluation workflows

---

## Non-goals

- No jailbreak content
- No claims about internal model telemetry
- No claims of clinical deployment readiness by default
- Not medical advice
- Not an AI doctor
- Not a productized monitoring platform
- Not a replacement for domain governance, QA, or regulatory review

---

## Current design principles

- **Observed > claimed**
- **External behavior over internal speculation**
- **Reproducibility over intuition**
- **Failure visibility over vague optimism**
- **Qualification over hype**
- **Model-agnostic evaluation over vendor lock-in**

## Current v0.6.1 implementation boundary

CASEF v0.6.1 currently provides authoritative gate semantics and canonical contract documentation. It does not yet provide an executable canonical qualification pipeline, canonical evidence-generation workflow, or live qualification capability.

The contracts define which future records and evidence bindings are required. They do not provide the runner, validators, rater protocols, review workflow, or PI-approved gate rules still required before canonical evidence can be generated or qualification can be issued.

---

## What CASEF is not trying to prove

CASEF does **not** prove that a model is globally safe, aligned, or clinically valid.

It is narrower and more useful than that.

It helps answer questions like:

- Did the model violate an explicit constraint?
- Did it stay within its intended role?
- Did it abstain or escalate when required?
- Is the observed behavior documented in a reviewable form?
- Can another reviewer inspect the same artifact and reach the same conclusion?

---

## Intended users

CASEF is relevant for:

- clinical AI researchers
- evaluation engineers
- safety and reliability engineers
- high-stakes product teams
- QA / validation teams
- researchers building portable evidence-driven evaluation workflows

---

## Status

**Active development**

The v0.6.1 contract foundation currently establishes:

- authoritative qualification and gate semantics in `docs/gates.md`;
- canonical evidence ownership in `docs/canonical_evidence_contract.md`;
- documentation-level contracts for test specification, planned execution, observed execution, and deterministic validation;
- documentation-level Context-of-Use and qualification-record contracts; and
- a pending `rater_record` contract.

No executable canonical qualification pipeline, canonical evidence pack, or current model qualification is provided yet.

---

## Design philosophy

CASEF starts from a simple premise:

> In high-stakes AI, generation is cheap.  
> Qualification is not.

The framework is designed to make failure visible, evidence portable, and evaluation decisions more defensible.

## Conversational Audit Layer

CASEF defines conversation audit as a future protocol-defined subtype of `rater_record`, focused on:
- uncertainty markers
- abstain / escalate trace
- operator accept / reject
- provenance / source trace
- final action trace

The current document lists candidate payload fields only. It is not a complete rater protocol, independent canonical record, replayable evidence example, or decision engine. Qualification semantics remain governed only by `docs/gates.md`.

See:
- `measurement/conversation_audit_schema.md`

## Practical use

CASEF is most useful when you need to answer:

- What exactly failed?
- Where is the evidence?
- How do we name it consistently?
- How do we compare runs across models and platforms?
- What should block a bounded use versus remain a documented limitation?

## License / use posture

Use CASEF as an evaluation and qualification framework.
Do not present it as medical advice, clinical decision support, or proof of deployment readiness without additional domain- and context-specific validation.
